### Useful resources

- [MDN | Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids) - This is useful resource which helped me understand CSS Grid. I really liked this resource and will use it going forward.
- [MDN | Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This is useful resource which helped me understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
